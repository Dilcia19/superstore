- The Super Store was founded at the end of 2013 and started selling products in 2014. 
- The store has seen year over year growth in terms of sales and profits. 
- With the elimination of a few key products and a few unprofitable geographical markets, we will set up the super store to break record profits and sales in the upcoming years

**KPIs: A Brief Look**<br>
If you've had a chance to poke around on the dashboard, you may notice a few things:
1. Profits are increasing overall, but there are states that consistently underperform: Including but not limited to Texas and Illinois
2. Copiers and Phones are consistently in the sub-category of most profitable products
3. From the 3 segments: Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies - when compared by % of profit they brought each year, Furniture consistently brings in a smaller piece of the pie than the rest
4. Considering that sub-categories within Furniture are rarely in the top 5 most profitable products, or top 5 products with the highest sales revenue, it may be worth re-evaluating if the store needs to sell furniture at all  
5. The data is full of surprises, what will you find?

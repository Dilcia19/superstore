Additional dashboard data points:
- ✅ how much $ was generated in the last year?
    - ✅ did it increase/decrease?
    - ✅ are profits up?
    - ✅ are sales up?
- ✅ year/year sales trends
- ✅ top 5 products (% in margin, quantity)
- ✅ profit by region/shipping/segment
- ✅ volume & total sales quantity
- ✅ most popular items
- ✅ gross rate for sales quantity
- ✅ retention rate - ie, how many of those customers have come back
- ✅ what % of purchases are repeated (customerID)
- ✅ also, what are repeat customers repeat buying 
- ✅ & which repeat products bring the highest profit
- ✅ what is the general ship date after order date
- ❌ does first class shipping decrease the margin of profitability
    - can't answer this with the data because it doesn't have information about how much each shipping mode costs
    - the profitability or lackthereof then cannot be assessed by high or low profits - as those can be attributed to the type of products among other things
    - ✅ what I did figure out is, per order First Class shipping provides the most profit
- ✅ volume is important - what category of product is most profitable
    - ✅ have a year/year chart of profitable product, popular product
        - I struggled with this one, we should work through it during our call
